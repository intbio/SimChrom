              The resource provides interactive tools to analyze human nuclear and chromatin proteins with respect to their subnuclear localization (from UniProt, HPA, OpenCell), chromatin category according to the developed simplified chromatin protein classification SimChrom, protein abundance (by PaxDB) and domain architecture (by PFAM). You can also download preprocessed MS-based chromatome datasets and nuclear/non-nuclear localization reference protein sets.

               <b>Protein domains co-occurence in SimChrom categories of chromatin regulators </b><br> Co-occurrence of protein domains that are often found in the chromatin regulators (Histone chaperones, Histone PTM erasers, Histone PTM writers, Histone PTM readers, Histone modification, Chromatin remodelers, Methylated DNA binding, DNA (de)methylation, RNA modification). 
From the list of PFAM domain pairs that were found in at least three chromatin regulator protein, domains involved in various histone post-translational modifications, chromatin remodeling, histone binding, DNA binding and protein dimerization/oligomerization were manually selected and classified based on the information currently available in the literature.
The conditional probability of finding a corresponding domain A in a chromatin protein given that another domain B is already present was estimated and is presented (columns and rows correspond to domains A and B, respectively). 
The number of proteins with the corresponding domain pair is given for all SimChrom proteins.
