# SimChrom - an interactive resource to explore function, composition and localization of human chromatin proteins

The resource provides interactive tools to analyze human nuclear and chromatin proteins with respect to their subnuclear localization (based on data from UniProt, HPA, OpenCell), chromatin category according to the developed simplified chromatin protein classification (SimChrom), protein abundance (from PaxDB), and domain architecture and composition (based on Pfam and predicted in TED). Preprocessed MS-based chromatome datasets and reference sets of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins are also available for download.

SimChrom is a supplementary resource to the paper "(Re)defining the human chromatome: an integrated meta-analysis of localization, function, abundance, physical properties and domain composition of chromatin proteins" by Anna K. Gribkova, Grigoriy A. Armeev, Mikhail P. Kirpichnikov, and Alexey K. Shaytan*
